# Facial-Expression-Detector

 Here I have built and trained a <b>convolutional neural network (CNN)</b> in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions.
 The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. 
 The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories 
 (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). I have used <b>OpenCV</b> to automatically detect faces in 
 images and draw bounding boxes around them. Once you have trained, saved, and exported the CNN, 
 you will directly serve the trained model to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.
 The entire project is then uploaded to web interface using <b>flask</b>
